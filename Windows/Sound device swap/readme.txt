This is an AutoHotKey script with the purpose of changing the default sound device for easier swapping of sound outputs.


Some minor changes might have to be made, i.e. my sound devices are 1 and 2.

Also, there are multiple icons depending if you want to use white or black tray icons.



To start the script, add it to your AHK and press win+h (can be changed in run.ahk)
